# External Dependencies

This folder is for source drops of external dependencies that can be cleanly
integrated with our CMake build system, whether by trivially constructing a
`CMakeLists.txt` or using one that's provided.

For source drops of external dependencies that are difficult to integrate into
CMake, look in [deps/src](../../deps/src/README.md).
